# WordPicturePlaceholderAddin

![Picture Add In](https://github.com/bigboybamo/WordPicturePlaceholderAddin/blob/master/Pictures/Picture_Add_In.png)

A lightweight VSTO add-in for Microsoft Word that helps you mark, find, and clean up image spots while drafting. It adds a small ribbon with three buttons:
- **Insert placeholder** ‚Äì Inserts a numbered picture placeholder like `(picture 1)`, `(picture 2)`, ‚Ä¶

- **Show placeholders** ‚Äì Lists all placeholders in the active document so you can jump to them.

- **Remove placeholder** ‚Äì Removes a specific placeholder by number.


## Why it exists

I built this after too many drafts juggling screenshots and losing track of ‚Äú(picture n)‚Äù notes. It gives me a dead-simple way to drop clear markers, see them all at once, and clean them up when the real images arrive.

## Features

- üî¢ Auto-numbered placeholders ‚Äì Always inserts the next number after the highest (picture N) found.
- üîé Document-wide listing ‚Äì Quickly see all placeholders, their numbers, and (if supported by Word) page context.
- ‚ùå Selective removal ‚Äì Remove by number to remove the placeholder. Automatic placeholder readjusting

## Requirements

- Windows: Word on Windows only (VSTO)
- Microsoft Word: 2016 or later / Microsoft 365
- .NET: .NET Framework 4.8 (or the framework your VSTO project targets)
- Visual Studio: 2019/2022 with Office developer tools (for development/build)
